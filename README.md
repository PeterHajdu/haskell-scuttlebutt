# Aim

Develop a higher level middleware/framework for the Scuttlebut.nz (SSB) network
for which it would be easy to develop various client applications.

As a bonus, it would be great if client applications could be written in a way that
multiple network/gossip protocols could be used at the same time for maximal interoperability.
